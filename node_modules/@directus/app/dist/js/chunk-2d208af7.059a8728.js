These can be\n> used to set layout defaults for a user, or to define bookmarks that can be used to recall windows\n> into specific datasets.\n\n## Creating a Preset\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Presets & Bookmarks**\n2. Click the **Create Preset** action button in the header\n3. Complete the **other preset form fields** outlined below\n\n-   **Collection** — The collection of this preset; supports any project collection, Directus Files,\n    or Directus Users\n-   **Scope** — The users that will have access to this preset, either Global, a specific Role, or\n    an individual User\n-   **Layout** — The collection detail's layout this preset applies to\n-   **Name** — If left blank, this preset will act as a Default for the collection/layout; if given\n    a name, it will be shown as a bookmark\n\nAfter you have completed the form, the layout preview will be populated with live data. You can now\ntailor the layout as desired by updating the preview or the filter component in the page sidebar.\n\nEach preset saves all of the information needed to recreate a view of the collection/layou,\nincluding: the full-text search query, any advanced filters added, sort field, sort direction, and\nall other specific layout options.\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: Defaults vs Bookmarks\nIt's important to be aware of the difference between a collection's\n_defaults_ and its _bookmarks_, both of which are configured by presets. A _default_ is how a user\nwill initially view the collection detail without any further customization, while a _bookmark_ is a\nnamed dataset that can be recalled at any point via the [collection navigation](/concepts/users-roles-and-permissions).\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: System Defaults\nYou can also adjust the defaults and bookmarks for the Directus Activity,\nDirectus Files, and Directus Users collections.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: Order of Defaults\nMultiple defaults can be configured for a user, either for different layouts\nof even the same layout. In this case, the preset priority is: User, then Role, then Global.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n## Deleting a Preset\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Presets & Bookmarks > [Preset]**\n2. Click the red **Delete Preset** action button in the header\n3. Confirm this decision by clicking **Delete** in the dialog\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n:::danger Irreversible Change \nThis action is permanent and can not be undone. Please proceed with\ncaution.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n"}}]);
