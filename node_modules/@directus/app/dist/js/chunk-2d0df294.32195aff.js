Filters follow the syntax\n`filter[<field-name>][<operator>]=<value>`.\n\n#### Filter Operators\n\n| Operator     | Description                               |\n| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |\n| `_eq`        | Equal to                                  |\n| `_neq`       | Not equal to                              |\n| `_lt`        | Less than                                 |\n| `_lte`       | Less than or equal to                     |\n| `_gt`        | Greater than                              |\n| `_gte`       | Greater than or equal to                  |\n| `_in`        | Exists in one of the values               |\n| `_nin`       | Not in one of the values                  |\n| `_null`      | It is null                                |\n| `_nnull`     | It is not null                            |\n| `_contains`  | Contains the substring                    |\n| `_ncontains` | Doesn\'t contain the substring             |\n| `_rlike`     | Contains a substring using a wildcard     |\n| `_nrlike`    | Not contains a substring using a wildcard |\n| `_between`   | The value is between two values           |\n| `_nbetween`  | The value is not between two values       |\n| `_empty`     | The value is empty (null or falsy)        |\n| `_nempty`    | The value is not empty (null or falsy)    |\n| `_all`       | Contains all given related item\'s IDs     |\n| `_has`       | Has one or more related items\'s IDs       |\n\n#### Filter: Relational\n\nYou can filter by relational values by appending the field names in nested sections in the parameter, as follows:\n\n`?filter[author][name][_eq]=Rijk`\n\n#### Filtering using JSON\n\nThe `filter` parameter supports the full [Filter Rules](/reference/filter-rules) syntax. As a matter of fact, the\nstandard array-like syntax is parsed to an object in execution. This means that you can also pass filter rules as a JSON\nobject in the parameter directly:\n\n```\n?filter={ "status": { "_eq": "active" }}\n```\n\n#### AND vs OR\n\nSee [Filter Rules](/reference/filter-rules) for more information on how to nest logical operations in a filter.\n'}}]);
