It takes\n> significant resources to maintain and advance the platform. If you'd like to help keep Directus\n> active and open-source please consider supporting it through one of the methods below.\n\n## Financial Support\n\nTalented full-time and part-time staff, infrastructure, and third-party services are just some of\nour organization's expenses, and revenue from our Cloud services and donations from sponsors doesn't\nfully cover those costs. Below are a few ways to help us keep the lights on and move towards\nself-sufficiency.\n\n### GitHub Sponsors\n\nMonthly donations via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/directus) are the most reliable\nform of financial support. Donate to the organization, or directly to our core developers!\n\n-   [Directus](https://github.com/sponsors/directus) — Organization\n-   [rijkvanzanten](https://github.com/rijkvanzanten) — Technical Lead\n-   [WoLfulus](https://github.com/WoLfulus) — DevOps\n-   [Nitwel](https://github.com/Nitwel) — Developer\n\n### Sponsored Work\n\n[Commissioned Features](/getting-started/support#commissioned-features) and\n[Expedited Fixes](/getting-started/support-expedited-features) are great ways to financially support\nthe development of Directus, and improve the codebase for the community.\n\n### Merch\n\nOur merchandise is a great way to support Directus — you get some swag, and we get some financial\nsupport and advertising. Simply make an appropriate financial donation through\n[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/directus), message us with sizing/shipping details,\nand we'll get it shipped!\n\n## Other Contributions\n\nBelow are several ways anyone can help improve our ecosystem.\n\n### Code Pull Requests\n\nSquashing bugs, optimizing the codebase, increasing test coverage, and adding new features, are all\nextremely valuable. Not technical? We have plenty of documentation that can always use some extra\nattention. Learn more in our [Contributors Guide](/getting-started/contributing).\n\n### Translations\n\nEvery translation enables users in new languages to use our international platform. Our\n[Crowdin integration](https://locales.directus.io) makes polishing existing translations or creating\nnew ones a breeze.\n\n### Bug Reporting\n\nIf you encounter an issue within Directus, no matter how small, we would love to hear about it.\nProper bug reporting helps our team assess the platform's stability.\n[Report a bug](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/new)\n\n### Brand Advocacy\n\nYou can create _perfect_ software, but if no one knows about it, it's all for naught. Marketing and\nadvertising are expensive, but you can help us avoid these costs with the following quick options:\n\n-   **GitHub Stars** — The primary metric by which we measure our success. It only takes five\n    seconds to head to [directus/directus](https://github.com/directus/directus) and click the star\n    — enough in a short period of time and Directus gets featured on GitHub's trending page!\n-   **Social Posts** — A quick post mentioning [@directus](https://twitter.com/directus) goes a long\n    way, and we re-tweet the team's favorite shout-outs to our 35K+ followers.\n-   **Testimonials** — _One sentence._ Even that was a sentence, and it was only two words! If\n    you're a fan of Directus, we'd love to hear why with a short endorsement. Shoot us an\n    [email](mailto:info@directus.io), [Tweet](https://twitter.com/directus), or\n    [Discord](https://directus.chat) message with your name, title, and company.\n"}}]);
