After that, you are free to extend and customize these as much as is needed.\n\n## Creating a Role\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Roles & Permissions**\n2. Click the **Create Role** action button in the header\n3. Enter a unique **Role Name**\n4. Enabling **App Access** allows logging in to the App\n5. Enabling **Admin Access** gives full permission to project data and Settings\n\n## Configuring a Role\n\n-   **Permissions** — Defines the role\'s access permissions\n-   **Role Name** — This is the name of the role\n-   **Role Icon** — The icon used throughout the App when referencing this role\n-   **Description** — A helpful note that explains the role\'s purpose\n-   **App Access** — Allows logging in to the App\n-   **Admin Access** — Gives full permission to project data and Settings\n-   **IP Access** — An allow-list of IP addresses from which the platform can be accessed, empty\n    allows all\n-   **Require 2FA** — Forces all users within this role to use two-factor authentication\n-   **Users in Role** — A list of all users within this role\n-   **Module Navigation** — Overrides the visible modules\n-   **Collection Navigation** — Overrides the collection module\'s navigation\n\n### Customizing the Module Navigation\n\nThe options in the [Module Bar](/concepts/app-overview) can be overridden with custom options per\nrole. When this setting is empty, the default modules are used.\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Roles & Permissions > [Role Name]**\n2. Scroll to the **Module Navigation** field\n3. Click the **Add a new item** button to add a module\n4. Choose an **Icon** to display for the module\n5. Choose a **Name** for the module\n6. Enter a relative (App) or absolute (external) **link** for the module\n7. Use the drag handles to **drag-and-drop** the modules into the desired order\n\nIf you are looking to replicate the default modules, paste the following configuration into the\nModule Navigation field using the Raw Value field label option.\n\n```json\n[\n\t{\n\t\t"icon": "box",\n\t\t"name": "Collections",\n\t\t"link": "/collections"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t"icon": "people_alt",\n\t\t"name": "User Directory",\n\t\t"link": "/users"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t"icon": "folder",\n\t\t"name": "File Library",\n\t\t"link": "/files"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t"icon": "info",\n\t\t"name": "Documentation",\n\t\t"link": "/docs"\n\t}\n]\n```\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: warning Settings Module\nThe settings module is not controlled by this configuration. It is always\nadded to the end of the list for any user\'s with Admin Access.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip Customizing Existing Modules\nYou can enter the link to an existing module to customize its name\nor icon. For example, you can use `/collections` to override the Collections module.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n### Customizing the Collection Navigation\n\nThe collections in the [Navigation Bar](/concepts/app-overview) can be overridden with custom\noptions per role. When this setting is empty, all collections that the user has permission to see\nare shown alphabetically in a single, unlabeled group.\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Roles & Permissions > [Role Name]**\n2. Scroll to the **Collection Navigation** field\n3. Click the **Add New Group** button to add a Grouping\n4. Enter a **Group Name**, or leave it empty to simply show a divider\n5. Choose if the group\'s **Accordion** will be...\n    - Always Open (Default)\n    - Start Open\n    - Start Collapsed\n6. Click the **Add New Collection** button to add a Collection\n7. Choose a **Collection** from the dropdown\n8. Use the drag handles to **drag-and-drop** the groups/collections into the desired order\n\n## Configuring Role Permissions\n\nDirectus possesses an extremely granular, yet easy to configure, permissions system. When creating a\nnew role, permissions are disabled for all project collections by default — allowing you to give\nexplicit access to only what is required. Individual permissions are applied to the role, and each\nis scoped to a specific collection and CRUD action (create, read, update, delete).\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: warning Saves Automatically\nEvery change made to the permissions of a role is saved automatically\nand instantly.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: warning Admin Roles\nIf a role is set to **Admin Access** then it is granted complete access to\nthe platform, and therefore the permission configuration field is disabled.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Roles & Permissions > [Role Name]**\n2. Scroll to the **Permissions** section\n3. **Click the icon** for the collection (row) and action (column) you want to set\n4. Choose the desired permission level: **All Access**, **No Access**, or **Use Custom**\n\nIf you selected _All Access_ or _No Access_ then setup is complete. If you chose to customize the\npermissions, then a modal will open with additional configuration options. Continue with the\nappropriate guide below based on the _action_ of the permission.\n\n#### Create (Custom)\n\n5. **Field Permissions** control which fields accept a value on create. Fields are individually\n   toggled.\n6. **Field Validation** define the rules for field values on create\n7. **Field Presets** control the field defaults when creating an item\n\n#### Read (Custom)\n\n5. **Item Permissions** control which items can be read, as defined by the\n   [Filter Rules](/reference/filter-rules) entered.\n6. **Field Permissions** control which fields can be read. Fields are individually toggled.\n\n#### Update (Custom)\n\n5. **Item Permissions** control which items can be updated, as defined by the\n   [Filter Rules](/reference/filter-rules)) entered.\n6. **Field Permissions** control which fields can be updated. Fields are individually toggled.\n7. **Field Validation** define the rules for field values on update, as defined by the\n   [Filter Rules](/reference/filter-rules) entered.\n8. **Field Presets** control the field defaults when updating an item\n\n#### Delete (Custom)\n\n5. **Item Permissions** control which items can be deleted, as defined by the\n   [Filter Rules](/reference/filter-rules)) entered.\n\n## Configuring System Permissions\n\nIn addition to setting permissions for your project\'s collections, you can also tailor the\npermissions for system collections. It is important to note that when\n[App Access](/concepts/users-roles-and-permissions) is enabled for a role, Directus will\nautomatically add permission for the necessary system collections. To edit system permissions,\nsimply click the "System Collections" toggle, and then edit permissions using the same steps as with\nproject collections.\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip Resetting System Permissions\nTo reset the role\'s system permissions for proper App access,\nexpand the system collections and then click "Reset System Permissions" at the bottom of the\nlisting.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n## Deleting a Role\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Roles & Permissions > [Role Name]**\n2. Click the red **Delete Role** action button in the header\n3. Confirm this decision by clicking **Delete** in the dialog\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: warning Users in a Deleted Role\nIf you delete a role that still has users in it, those users will\nbe given a `NULL` role, which denies their App access and limits them to the [Public](/concepts/users-roles-and-permissions)\npermissions. They can then be reassigned to a new role by an admin.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: warning Last Admin\nYou must maintain at least one role/user with Admin Access so that you can\nstill properly manage the project.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: warning Public Role\nYou can not delete the Public role, as it is part of the core platform. To\ndisable it completely, simply turn off all Public access permissions.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n'}}]);
