Not only does Directus allow you to author\n> and manage multilingual content, the App itself also supports multiple languages and locales.\n\n## App Translations\n\nDirectus supports internationalization across its entire Admin App. Many languages are currently\nsupported, with more are being added all the time. Help the community by adding or refining your\nlanguage through our [CrowdIn](https://locales.directus.io/) integration.\n\n## Schema Translations\n\nDirectus uses [database mirroring](/concepts/platform-overview#database-mirroring) to dynamically pull in your schema's tables and columns,\nhowever this only covers one language. Therefore our platform supports schema translations for these\nnames, allowing you to properly support different languages for your Collection and Field names.\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip Overriding Technical\nNames If your project requires more _technical_ table/column names (eg:\n`cust` or `f_name`), you can also use schema translations to override those defaults (eg:\n`Customers` or `First Name`) in the primary language.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n## Content Translations\n\nOne of the most important features in Directus is the ability to author and manage multilingual\ncontent. While you can accomplish this by creating _standard_ fields in the parent collection for\neach language, it is more extensible to use our relational translation fields to dynamically manage\ncontent in as many languages as is required. Mixing standard and translated fields also allows\nlanguage-agnostic data (such as dates or toggles) to remain within the parent collection.\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip Custom Interfaces\nFor more advanced use-cases, such as connecting to a third-party\ntranslation service, you can read our extension guide on\n[creating a custom interface](/guides/extensions/interfaces).\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n"}}]);
