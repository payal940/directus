Activity can be accessed in two\nways, via the main [Activity Module](/concepts/app-overview#activity-history), or within the sidebar\nof individual [Item Detail](/concepts/app-overview#item-detail) pages. The following information is\nstored for each event's activity item:\n\n-   Action\n-   User\n-   Datetime\n-   IP Address\n-   User Agent\n-   Collection\n-   Item\n-   Comment (when applicable)\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip Readonly\nFor proper accountability, activity records are readonly. Administrators should\navoid changing, deleting, or truncating this data.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: warning External Events\nDirectus can only track events that pass through the platform's\nmiddleware. Changes made directly to the database, or by other external means, are not included in\nthe activity log.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n## Versions\n\nEvery change made to items in Directus are also stored as a versioned snapshot. This additional data\nis also linked to the specific Activity event which created it. Below are the two key pieces of\ninformation stored for each version:\n\n-   Data — A full snapshot of the item _after_ the event\n-   Delta — The specific field data changed by this event\n\n\x3c!-- @TODO ::: tip Customizing Version Data\nSince versions store a full data snapshot and delta, the\n`directus_revisions` collection can quickly grow quite large, increasing database size and\npotentially decreasing performance. To remedy this, Directus allows\n[configuring version scope](/concepts/app-overview) per collection to set the exact field data\nsaved.\n::: --\x3e\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip Creating Detached Versions\nYou can also create a new version for an item without saving the\ndata to the parent item itself. This allows you to \"stage\" changes to an item that may already be\nlive/published.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n### Relevant Guides\n\n-   [Reverting an Item](/guides/items#reverting-an-item)\n-   [Changing an Item's Version](/guides/items)\n"}}]);
