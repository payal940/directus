It can be used as a\nheadless CMS for managing project content, a database client for modeling and viewing raw data, or\nas a standalone customizable WebApp.\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip What's in a name?\n\"Directus\" ([duh REKT iss](http://audio.pronouncekiwi.com/Salli/Directus)) is latin for: _laid straight,\narranged in lines_. The broadest goal of our platform is to present data in a simple, orderly, and\nintuitive way.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n## What makes it unique?\n\n**Directus dynamically generates custom API endpoints based on your SQL database's custom schema in\nreal-time — something we call \"Database Mirroring\".** Whether you install fresh or on top of an\nexisting database, you always maintain complete control over your actual database... including\ntables, columns, datatypes, default values, indexes, relationships, etc.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest advantages of _Database Mirroring_ is that you have direct access to your\npure and unaltered data. That means you can even bypass the Directus middleware (API, SDK, App), and\nconnect to your data with proper SQL queries — effectively removing all bottlenecks, additional\nlatency, or proprietary access limitations.\n\nDirectus is a simple solution for complex problems. Every aspect of Directus is data-first and\nguided by the following core principles:\n\n-   **Pure** — There is no predefined model or proprietary rules for your agnostic schema, and all\n    system settings are stored separately.\n-   **Open** — Our entire codebase is public and transparent, allowing for end-to-end audits.\n    Nothing is obfuscated or black-boxed.\n-   **Portable** — Data is stored in your bespoke database and can be migrated/exported/backed-up at\n    any time. Absolutely no vendor lock-in.\n-   **Limitless** — Create unlimited users, roles, languages, collections, and items. No arbitrary\n    restrictions or paywall limitations.\n-   **Extensible** — Every aspect of the platform is modular, allowing you to adapt, customize, and\n    infinitely extend the Core engine.\n-   **Unopinionated** — Choose your stack (node or PHP), database (all SQL vendors), API (REST or\n    GraphQL), and infra (self-hosted or Cloud).\n\n## The Directus Ecosystem\n\n### Open-Source Engine\n\nCompletely free and open-source on the GPLv3 license, Directus is publicly available within our\n[npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/directus) and main\n[GitHub repository](https://github.com/directus/directus).
