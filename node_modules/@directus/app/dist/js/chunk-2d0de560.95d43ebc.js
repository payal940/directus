Each user is assigned to a role that determines what they have\naccess to see and do. For instance, some users have access to the App, while others can only connect to the API.\nDirectus ships with a number of profile fields that help create a full-featured\n[User Directory](/concepts/app-overview#user-directory), and setting fields that allow customizing your experience.\n\nAll Directus users are aggregated and shown on the [User Directory](/concepts/app-overview#user-directory) page of the\nApp\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip Extending Directus Users\nWhile the included fields within Directus Users are required/locked,\nyou can still _extend_ this collection with additional custom fields as needed. You can do this via\nthe normal [Create a new Field](/guides/fields) process from within the system collection.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Setting up your User Profile](/guides/users#setting-up-your-user-profile)\n- [Inviting a User](/guides/users#inviting-a-user)\n- [Creating a User](/guides/users#creating-a-user)\n- [Archiving a User](/guides/users#archiving-a-user)\n- [Deleting a User](/guides/users#deleting-a-user)\n\n## Roles\n\nEach user is assigned to one Role, which determines their permissions within the App and API. There is no limit to the\nnumber of roles you can create within Directus, so feel free to organize your users in whatever way feels most\nappropriate.\n\n### Public Role\n\nPublic is not technically a role, and can't be found in the `directus_roles` table. Instead, it represents the _lack_ of\na role, providing a place to configure permissions for unauthenticated users. This role can not be deleted, and has no\npermissions by default.\n\n### Administrators Role\n\nUpon installation, Directus automatically creates this initial role to grant access to the first admin user. It is just\na normal role, and like any other it can be updated, renamed or deleted, however your project must maintain at least one\nrole with Admin Access at all times.\n\n### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Creating a Role](/guides/roles-and-permissions#creating-a-role)\n- [Deleting a Role](/guides/roles-and-permissions#deleting-a-role)\n\n## Permissions\n\nDirectus gives you granular, filter-based permissions for managing access-control.\n\n### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Managing Permissions](/guides/roles-and-permissions)\n"}}]);
