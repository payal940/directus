Our community and core developers often check this platform and answer posts. It has\nthe added benefit of being an archival resource for others developers with similar questions.\n\nOur [Discord](https://directus.chat) community is another great way to get assistance. Please keep\nall questions on the `#help` channel, be considerate, and remember that you are getting free help \nfrom the community for a free product.\n\n## Premium Support\n\nPremium support is included with our Enterprise Cloud service. On-Demand Cloud customers and\nOn-Premise users interested in learning more about our monthly retainer agreements should contact us\nat [support@directus.io](mailto:support@directus.io).\n\n## Sponsored Work\n\n### Commissioned Features\n\nIf you need a specific feature added to Directus faster than the normal development timeline,\n[reach out to us](https://directus.io/contact/) for a quote. Our parent agency will often help\nsubsidize the cost of developing new features if they pass our\n[80/20 Rule](/getting-started/contributing) and can be merged into the core codebase. Other\ncustom/proprietary development will be built bespoke within our robust extension system.\n\n### Expedited Fixes\n\nWe triage all reported bugs based on priority and how long the fix is estimated to take. If you need\na specific issue resolved sooner, [reach out to us](https://directus.io/contact/) for a quote.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\x3c!--\n@TODO\n### Does Directus handle deploying or migrating projects?\n\nDirectus includes [export](#) and [backup](#) tools to assist in deploying data changes between\nenvironments (eg: from _development_ to _production_), however there is no formal migration\nworkflow.\n\nAdditionally, since Directus stores all of your data in pure SQL, you can use almost any preexisting\nworkflow or toolkit for this process. --\x3e\n\n### Does Directus support Mongo/NoSQL?\n\nNot currently. Directus has been built specifically for wrapping _relational_ databases. While we\ncould force Mongo to use tables, columns, and rows via Mongoose object modeling, that approach to\nnon-structured doesn't make a lot of sense. We realize many users are interested in this feature,\nand will continue to explore its possibility.\n\n### Why haven't you added this feature, or fixed that issue yet?\n\nDirectus is primarily a free and open-source project, maintained by a small core team and community\ncontributors who donate their time and resources.\n\nOur platform is feature-rich, however we strictly adhere to our\n[80/20 Rule](/getting-started/contributing) to avoid a messy/bloated codebase. Directus is also\nquite stable, however new issues still arise, some of which may be triaged with a lower\nprioritization.\n\nIf you require more expeditious updates, you can contact us regarding\n[sponsoring expedited fixes](#expedited-fixes) or\n[commissioning new features](#commissioned-features). You can also\n[submit a pull request](https://github.com/directus/directus/pulls) â€” after all, it is open-source!\n\n### Can you give an ETA for this feature/fix?\n\nIf it is sponsored work, then yes, delivery dates are part of our statement of work agreements.\nOtherwise, most likely not. This is open-source software, work is prioritized internally, and all\ntimelines are subject to change.\n\n### But this is an emergency, my very important project requires it now!\n\nWe understand, and are here to help. If you need something prioritized, you can reach out to us to\ndiscuss [premium support](#premium-support), [sponsoring expedited fixes](#expedited-features) or\n[commissioning new features](#commissioned-features).\n"}}]);
