Common CLI clients are [Windows Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Terminal) and [MacOS Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)).\n> [Learn More about CLI](/reference/command-line-interface)\n\n## 1. Confirm the Minimum Requirements are met\n\n**The only language or script requirement for Directus is an actively maintained version of\n[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).** \nCurrently that is v10+, however in April 2021, node v10 will leave\n_Maintenance Long-Term Support (LTS)_ status, and node v12+ will become the new minimum requirement.\n\n### Databases\n\nDirectus currently supports the following databases, with our minimum version being based on each vendor's official support/LTS.\n\n| Database      | Version |\n| ------------- | ------- |\n| PostgreSQL    | 10+     |\n| MySQL         | 5.7.8+  |\n| SQLite        | 3+      |\n| MS-SQL Server | 13.0+   |\n| OracleDB      | TBD     |\n| MariaDB       | 10.2+   |\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip\nVariants In addition to the databases above, other variants are also supported, including **AWS Aurora** (MySQL), and **AWS Redshift** (PostgreSQL).\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n## 2. Create a Project\n\nNavigate to the directory where you wish to create a new Directus project.\nThe new project and directory will be created inside the current directory.\nCreate a new Directus project by running the following npm command.\n\n```bash\nnpx create-directus-project my-project\n```\n\n_my-project_ will also be the name of the new Directus project directory.\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: warning\nExcept for SQLite, the database must already be running before creating your Directus\nproject.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n## 3. Start your Project\n\nTo start Directus, navigate to the project directory, _my-project_.\n\n```bash\ncd my-project\n```\n\nRun the following command in your project directory.\n\n```bash\nnpx directus start\n```\n\n## 4. View your Project\nThe default port used by Directus is 8055.\nTo view your project locally, enter `http://localhost:8055` in your browser.\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip\nYou can confirm the port by looking for the message in your _terminal_ or _cli client_: \n**Server started at port 8055**\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n"}}]);
