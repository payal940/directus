If you're unfamiliar with Directus\n> Projects, please start by reading our [Platform Overview](/concepts/platform-overview).\n\n## Creating a Project\n\nTo install Directus, choose one of the following methods.\n\n-   [Command Line Interface (CLI)](/guides/installation/cli.md)\n-   [Docker](/guides/installation/docker.md)\n-   [Manually](/guides/installation/manual.md)\n\n## Configuring a Project\n\nAll project configuration is handled by the `.env` file within the `/api` directory. This file\naccepts a number of environment variables, each is explained in the following reference:\n\n-   [Environment Variables](/reference/environment-variables)\n\n## Upgrading a Project\n\n1. Backup your project\n2. Run `npm update`\n3. Run `directus database migrate:latest` to update the DB\n\n## Backing-up a Project\n\n1. Make a copy of the **files within each storage adapter**, and store them in a safe place\n2. Make a copy of the **Env file** (`/api/.env`), and store it in a safe place\n3. Run the **Backup API Endpoint** (`/backup`) to create a SQL dump of your database\n\n## Deleting a Project\n\n1. Optional: **Backup any local files** stored within the project's root directory\n2. Optional: **Backup any custom code and extensions** within the project's root directory\n3.

Any external services connecting to your database's project tables\ndirectly (eg: SQL queries) should continue working normally.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n"}}]);
