It uses a\n> left-to-right visual hierarchy for organization and navigation. Below we cover the App's global\n> elements and individual pages.\n\n## Global Elements\n\n<img class=\"full shadow\" src=\"https://svgshare.com/i/Q8H.svg\" />\n<img class=\"full no-margin\" src=\"https://svgshare.com/i/Q8J.svg\" />\n\n### 1. Module Bar\n\n-   **Project Logo** — Displays your configured project logo and project color (defaults to the\n    Directus logo and color). If configured, clicking this component will navigate to the Project\n    URL. During platform activity, an indeterminate progress indicator will also be shown here.\n-   **Modules** — Any available modules are listed below the project logo. These may be turned off\n    or reordered based on your [role's configuration](/concepts/users-roles-and-permissions), but by\n    default this includes:\n    -   [Collections](/concepts/app-overview)\n    -   [User Directory](/concepts/app-overview)\n    -   [File Library](/concepts/app-overview)\n    -   [Documentation](/concepts/app-overview)\n    -   [Settings](/concepts/app-overview) — Admin only\n    -   [Custom Modules](/guides/extensions/modules) — If configured\n-   **Current User Menu** — This component displays the authenticated user's name and avatar.\n    Hovering over this menu exposes the Log Out button.\n\n### 2. Navigation Bar\n\n-   **Project Name** — Shows the name of your current project (see\n    [Project Settings](/guides/white-labeling)), as well as the quality of your project's API\n    connection.\n-   **Navigation** — This is a dynamic navigation based on your current module. Some modules also\n    support [Presets and/or Bookmarks](/guides/roles-and-permissions), which are ways to link to\n    more specific data-sets.\n\n### 3. Page\n\n-   **Header** — A fixed section at the top of each page, the header includes:\n    -   Page Icon — Clicking this navigates back to the previous page\n    -   Module Title — Clicking this navigates to the parent module/section\n    -   Page Title — Displays the current page's title\n    -   Action Buttons — On the right-side of the header are contextual buttons for specific page\n        actions. Please note that some primary action buttons have a \"...\" icon beside them that\n        provides additional options when clicked.\n-   **Page Content** — This displays the content of the page you navigated to.\n\n### 4. Page Sidebar\n\n-   **Page Components** — Lists any contextual page components available. The \"Info\" component is\n    available on every page, explaining the page's general purpose and relevant details. Clicking\n    any sidebar component will accordion it open. If the App window is large enough, the sidebar\n    will automatically open, and can be closed by clicking the \"X\" in the top-right.\n-   **Notifications Tray** — Fixed to the bottom of the page sidebar, this button opens a tray of\n    recent user notifications, and provides a link to the [Activity History](/concepts/app-overview)\n    page.\n\n## Collections\n\nThis module is the primary way for interacting with your database content. Here you can access your\ncollections, browse their items, and navigate to individual item forms.\n\n### Collection Listing\n\nA page that lists the collections available to the current user. This is the landing page of the\nmodule, and effectively the same as its navigation listing.\n\n### Collection Detail\n\nProvides a configurable layout to browse or visualize items within a given collection. Like other\nbrowse pages, there are many available features, including:\n\n-   [Creating Items](/guides/items#creating-items)\n-   [Browsing Items](/guides/items#browsing-items)\n    -   [Searching](/guides/items#searching)\n    -   [Layouts](/guides/items#layouts)\n    -   [Advanced Filter](/guides/items#advanced-filter)\n    -   [Bookmarking](/guides/items#bookmark)\n-   [Updating Items](/guides/items#updating-items)\n-   [Deleting Items](/guides/items#deleting-items)\n-   [Export Data](/guides/items#export-data)\n\n### Item Detail\n\nMost layouts on the browse page support navigating to individual item detail pages, where you a\npresented with a [customizable form](/guides/fields#adjusting-fields-layout) for viewing/editing the\nitem's content. Like other detail pages, there are many available features, including:\n\n-   [Updating an Item](/guides/items#updating-item)\n-   [Reverting an Item](/guides/items#reverting-item)\n-   [Revisions](/guides/items#revisions)\n-   [Comments](/guides/items#comments)\n\n## User Directory\n\nA module includes a comprehensive listing of all system users within your project. This page has the\nsame features and configuration as [Collection Detail](/concepts/app-overview).\n\n### User Detail\n\nSimilar to other [Item Detail](/concepts/app-overview) pages, this page provides a custom form for\nviewing system users. This is also used for editing the \"Profile Page\" of the current user, which is\naccessible from the [User Menu](/concepts/app-overview). Directus ships with a full-featured user\nsystem, with the following fields:\n\n-   **First Name** — The user's given name\n-   **Last Name** — The user's family name\n-   **Email** — The user's email address used for login/authenticating and email updates\n-   **Password** — The private string used for login/authenticating (stored as a secure hash)\n-   **Avatar** — An image displayed throughout the App that represents the user\n-   **Location** — Can be used for the user's city, country, office name, etc\n-   **Title** — The name of the position the user holds at their company or organization\n-   **Description** — A description or bio of the user\n-   **Tags** — A set of keywords useful when searching within the User Directory\n-   **Timezone** — (User Preference) The timezone of the user\n-   **Language** — (User Preference) The language to use for this user's App language\n-   **Theme** — (User Preference) Light, Dark, or Auto (based on the user's OS preferences)\n-   **Two-Factor Auth** — (User Preference) Enables authenticating with 2FA\n-   **Status** — (Admin Only) Determines if the user is active within the App/API\n-   **Role** — (Admin Only) The user's role determines their permissions and access\n-   **Token** — (Admin Only) A static string used for authenticating within the API\n\nThe sidebar's info component also includes the following readonly details:\n\n-   **User Key** — The primary key of the user\n-   **Last Access** — The timestamp of the user's last App or API action\n-   **Last Page** — The last App page accessed by the user\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip Extending Users\nWhile the fields included out-of-the-box are locked from schema changes, you\ncan extend Directus Users to include additional proprietary fields within\n[Settings > Data Model](/concepts/data-model).\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n## File Library\n\nThis module aggregates all files within the project into one consolidated library. This page has the\nsame features and configuration as [Collection Detail](/concepts/app-overview).\n\n### File Detail\n\nSimilar to other [Item Detail](/concepts/app-overview) pages, this page provides a custom form for\nviewing assets and embeds.

It also includes a dynamic [API Reference](/reference/api/introduction) that is\ndynamically tailored to your custom schema. The docs are organized into four distinct sections:\n\n-   [Getting Started](/getting-started/introduction) — Novice Oriented. For a platform intro and installation.\n-   [Concepts](/concepts/app-overview) — Learning Oriented. For understanding the platform.\n-   [Guides](/concepts/roles-and-permissions) — Problem Oriented. Follow along with steps while working.\n-   [Reference](/reference/api/introduction) — Information Oriented. Look up info and specs while working.\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: tip Updating the Docs\nOur docs are written in markdown (with some additional VuePress styling\nlike this hint box), and available for editing/fixing via\n[GitHub](https://github.com/directus/directus).\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n## Activity History\n\nThis module provides a collective timeline of all actions taken within the project. This is a great\nway to audit user activity or enforce accountability. This is the only system module that is not in\nthe module bar by default — instead being located within the notifications tray of the page sidebar.\nThis page has the same features and configuration as [Collection Detail](/concepts/app-overview).\n\n### Activity Detail\n\nUnlike other item detail pages, activity items are **readonly** (for proper accountability) and open\nin a modal window with the following fields:\n\n-   **User** — The Directus user that performed the action\n-   **Action** — The specific action taken, eg: Create, Update, Delete, Authenticate, etc\n-   **Date** — The timestamp of when the action was performed\n-   **IP Address** — The IP address of the device from which the action was performed\n-   **User Agent** — The description of the browser that was used to perform the action\n-   **Collection** — The collection affected by the action\n-   **Item** — The item (within the above Collection) affected by the action\n\n## Settings\n\nThis module is only available to users within\n[admin roles](/concepts/users-roles-and-permissions#administrators-role). This is where your project\nis configured, and the first place to go after installation. It includes the following sections:\n\n-   [Project Settings](/concepts/platform-overview)\n-   [Data Model](/concepts/data-model)\n-   [Roles & Permissions](/concepts/users-roles-and-permissions)\n-   [Presets & Bookmarks](/concepts/presets-and-bookmarks)\n-   [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks)\n"}}]);
