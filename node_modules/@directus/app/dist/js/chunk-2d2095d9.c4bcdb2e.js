This includes multiple storage\n> adapters, nested folder organization, private file access, image editing, and on-demand thumbnail\n> generation.\n\n## Storage Adapters\n\nStorage adapters allow project files to be stored in different locations or services. By default,\nDirectus includes the following adapters:\n\n-   **Local Filesystem** — The default, any filesystem location or network-attached storage\n-   **S3 or Equivalent** — Including AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, Alibaba OSS, and others\n-   **Google Cloud Storage** — A RESTful web service on the Google Cloud Platform\n\n## Files\n\nDirectus allows you to manage all your files in one place, including documents, images, videos, and\nmore. Files can be uploaded to the [File Library](/concepts/app-overview#file-library) in general,\nor directly to an item via a [Single File](/guides/field-types/single-file) or\n[Multiple Files](/guides/field-types/multiple-files) field.\n\n### Relevant Guides\n\n-   [Uploading a File](/guides/files#uploading-a-file)\n-   [Requesting an Original File](/guides/files#accessing-an-original-file)\n\n## Embedded Assets\n\nDirectus also supports ingesting third-party embedded assets, such as YouTube or Vimeo videos. These\nare managed the same as normal files, however the resource itself is stored on the external service,\nand referenced via its proprietary UID.\n\n## Crop & Transform Images\n\nOur file middleware also allows for cropping and transforming image assets on the fly. This means\nyou can simply request an image, include any desired transformation parameters, and you'll be served\nthe new asset as a response. This is very useful for automatically generating many different\nthumbnails/versions of an original file.\n\nTo impede malicious users from consuming your storage by requesting a multitude of random sizes,\nDirectus includes a [Asset Allow-List](/guides/files#creating-thumbnail-presets) to limit what\ntransformations are possible.\n\n### Relevant Guides\n\n-   [Requesting a Thumbnail](/guides/files#requesting-a-thumbnail)\n"}}]);
